Hello world! Kicking off this blog will be the first of hopefully many more of
Miscellaneous Music posts, where I just throw out a bunch of album suggestions
that you may or may not want to listen to. The catch-22 is that you won't know
that you don't want to listen to the albums until you actually do.

1. Minnie Riperton - Adventures in Paradise
2. Mint Jams - 
4. Tom Misch - Geography

Most of the time, the suggestions won't be as cohesive as this list. These
three all have some catchy funk and disco elements, so if you're into
Jamiroquai then these might be your jam.
